As Han teaches Dre that kung fu is not about punches and parries, but maturity and calm, Dre realizes that facing down the bullies will be the fight of his life.	14.309	2596,5,5635,907,34,	Jerry Weintraub Productions,Columbia Pictures,China Film Group,Overbrook Entertainment,Sony Pictures,	US,US,,US,US,	2010-06-10	140	3666	6.4	357852395	A Challenge He Never Imagined.

His fifteen year old son has just told him he is gay and his eleven year old is afraid of, well pretty much everything.

Born on a Baja, California beach in 1959, new hatchling Sammy must do what his fellow newborn sea turtles are doing: race across the beach to the ocean before they are captured by a seagull or crab. Thus begins Sammy's incredible fifty-year ocean journey. Along the way he meets his best friend, a fellow turtle named Ray, and overcomes obstacles both natural and man-made while trying to fulfill his dream of travelling around the world. Throughout his voyage, Sammy never forgets about Shelly - the turtle he saved on his first day and loves passionately from afar. Based on the actual trajectory of a sea turtle's life, the film illustrates the dangers humans pose to the species' survival.

Behind some of the world's most revolutionary companies are a handful of men who (through timing, foresight, a keen ability to size up other people, and a lot of luck) saw opportunity where others did not: these are the original venture capitalists. All were backing and building companies before the term 'venture capital' had been coined: companies that led to the birth of biotechnology and the spectacular growth in microprocessors, personal computers and the web.

But what she finds is completely different from what she imagined.	0.714	87842,27559,2683,87843,12032,87844,87845,87846,	Comune di Castrignano del Capo,Bianca Film,Rai Cinema,Saietta Film,Apulia Film Commission,Provincia di Lecce,Provincia di Brindisi,Comune di Cisternino,	,,IT,,,,,,	2011-05-06	90	4	6.4	0		Giorgia Cecere,	Isabella Ragonese,Alberto Boll,Francesco Chiarello,Miriana Protopapa,Rita Schirinzi,Vigea Bechis Boll,Bianca Maria Stea Lindholm,Antonio Fumarola,	Giorgia Cecere,Pierpaolo Pirone,Yang Li Xiang,	Gianni Troilo,		Donatello Pisanello,

To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes—a washed-up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi)—who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together, they stand as mankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse.	19.233	101082,923,174,	Double Dare You Productions,Legendary Entertainment,Warner Bros.

They have no idea that so much more than steak is at stake and that the planet's fate may fall on their plates. Lured by tales of weight lost and health regained, they begin to uncover hidden sides of animal agriculture that make them wonder whether solutions offered in films like Food, Inc. go far enough. Before long, they find themselves risking everything to expose an industry they supported just weeks before. But can their convictions carry them through when times get tough? What about on family vacations fraught with skeptical step-dads, carnivorous cousins, and breakfast buffets? Part sociological experiment and part adventure comedy, Vegucated showcases the rapid and at times comedic evolution of three people who are trying their darnedest to change in a culture that seems dead set against it.	5.738				2011-01-09	76	18	7.0	0		Marisa Miller Wolfson,	T.

Feeling Blue and 31 is the story of two young men whose lives quite literally come to rest upon the performance of their appendages. Ege and Kerem are 25-year-old virgins who masturbate excessively. One day Eros appears to them and threatens to castrate them if they fail to get laid within the subsequent seven days. Thus begins an often hilarious, tragic- comic struggle to have sex which involves a dance class, bar-hopping and sultry neighbours. Shot as the result of a bet over just 24 hours, the film has a winningly natural feel, in large part due to the directors’ decision to allow the actors to improvise dialogue within the framework of each scene. First-time actors Ozan Özcan and Deniz Alnıtemiz are perfect as the bumbling, funny and frequently terribly embarrassing leads who come across a bit like Turkey’s answer to ‘Flight of the Conchords’.

A hit at the Berlin Film Festival, the film extends the earlier shadow puppet style of Ocelot’s Princes and Princesses, with black silhouetted characters set off against exquisitely detailed Day-Glo backgrounds bursting with color and kaleidoscopic patterns – the subtle use of 3D creating a diorama-like effect.  The film weaves together six exotic fables each unfolding in a unique locale, from Tibet, to medieval Europe, an Aztec kingdom, the African plains, and even the Land of the Dead. In Ocelot’s storytelling, history blends with fairytale as viewers are whisked off to enchanted lands full of dragons, werewolves, captive princesses, sorcerers, and enormous talking bees - and each fable ends with its own ironic twist.	4.997	57752,	Nord-Ouest Films,	FR,	2011-07-20	84	77	7.4	0		Michel Ocelot,	Julien Beramis,Marine Griset,Jonathan Kite,

Ronald Wright, whose best-seller, “A Short History Of Progress” inspired “Surviving Progress”, shows how past civilizations were destroyed by “progress traps”—alluring technologies and belief systems that serve immediate needs, but ransom the future. As pressure on the world’s resources accelerates and financial elites bankrupt nations, can our globally-entwined civilization escape a final, catastrophic progress trap? With potent images and illuminating insights from thinkers who have probed our genes, our brains, and our social behaviour, this requiem to progress-as-usual also poses a challenge: to prove that making apes smarter isn’t an evolutionary dead-end.	5.189				2011-11-04	86	19	7.2	0	Every time history repeats itself, the price goes up.

While it crosses all organisms within our ecological system completely indiscriminately (mixing plant with animal and humans) most plants prove more resistant because of their complex DNA. However, the simple genes of the plants lead humans to become grotesque mutations, in most cases even to death. Within one week, 90% of mankind are either extinct or no longer human. However, a small fraction of the earth?s population remains immune to the virus and must survive in this new and constantly changing ecological system. Tom cellar is one the survivors and on an old military base in the Eifel he has entrenched himself. Further survivors come together and succeed in carving out a life in this new world.

Life on a farm is all that sullen teen Marco knows- leading a perfunctory and quiet life of working, going to school and avoiding the advances of girls. However, his self-imposed solitude ends when curly-haired Jakob, rejecting the banking world for farming, arrives to train on the farm. Although initially cautious and tentative with each other, it is soon obvious that the unspoken sexual tension is becoming increasingly hard to resist - something a spontaneous trip to Berlin. Proving that true love can blossom in even the most unlikely of places, Harvest is as rich and rewarding as it is heart-warming.	3.103				2011-02-16	88	22	7.0	0		Benjamin Cantu,	Lukas Steltner,Kai Michael Müller,

A beautifully gaunt and gothic aristocrat, the unique distinctive fury of his guitar style shot him directly into the imagination of a generation. He was impeccable, the austerity of his artistry embodied in his finely wrought form, his obscure tastes and his intelligently wry wit. He radiated a searing personal integrity that never seemed to tarnish. Despite the trials and tribulations of his career, in an age of makeover and reinvention, Rowland Howard never ‘sold out’. With recent and moving interviews, archival interviews and other fascinating and original footage, AUTOLUMINESCENT traces the life of Rowland S Howard. Capturing moments with the man himself and intimate missives from those who knew him behind closed doors; words and images etch light into what has always been the mysterious dark.	2.643	1253,105801,	Australian Broadcasting Corporation,MIFF Premiere Fund,	AU,AU,	2011-10-27	110	6	7.3	0		Richard Lowenstein,Lynn-Maree Milburn,	Rowland S.

He's a loner, who prefers old timetables to people, and he finds the loneliness of the station tranquil – except when the fog rolls in. Then he hallucinates, sees trains from the last hundred years pass through the station. They bring ghosts and shadows from the dark past of Central Eu­rope. Alois can’t get rid of these nightmares and eventually ends up in sanatorium.  In the sanatorium, he gets to know The Mute, a man carrying an old photograph who was arrested by the police after crossing the border.

This began on the back of the mod revival of the late 1970s when notorious football firms from the cities like Liverpool, Manchester and London stole expensive designer sportswear from the countries they visited. It didn’t start with the high-street giants telling these lads what to wear. Instead, they set the trends and the high-street stores caught up. As the 1980s began in Britain, under the radar the ‘casual’ had already arrived.  From Barcelona to Berlin, Milan to Moscow, teenagers today are copying fashions and a culture that developed on the streets and terraces of British cities. But how did the football casual subculture come about? What did they stand for? What made them tick? Why it’s legacy is still having an impact on today’s fashion industry.	1.602				2011-11-28	75	5	5.9	0	The Story Of The Legendary Terrace Fashion	Mick Kelly,	Peter Hooton,Jonny Owen,Paolo Hewitt,Garry Bushell,Cass Pennant,Pat Nevin,Gary Aspden,Ian Hough,Tony Graham,Riaz Khan,Nic Dunnaway,Robert Wade Smith,Chris Donnelly,Ricky Magowan,Mick Robinson,Bev Thompson,Martin Pel,Bob Morris,Phil Thornton,Neil Primett,Phil Tucker,Ravi Grewal,Jason Reeves,Mab Jiwa,Nick Serjeant,

Under the cover of darkness a small boy, Maki, loosens the shackles that bind him and escapes into the desert night. Pursued by slavers across the moon-lit savannah, Maki meets Zarafa, a baby giraffe – and an orphan, just like him – as well as the nomad Hassan, Prince of the Desert. Hassan takes them to Alexandria for an audience with the Pasha of Egypt, who orders him to deliver the exotic animal as a gift to King Charles of France.	3.203	591,3144,7766,7981,11199,32853,81536,	France 3 Cinéma,Prima Linéa Productions,Chaocorp,Pathé!,SCOPE Pictures,Gkids,NYAV Post,	FR,FR,,FR,BE,,,	2012-01-25	78	50	6.9	0		Rémi Bezançon,Jean-Christophe Lie,	Max Renaudin,Simon Abkarian,Vernon Dobtcheff,Roger Dumas,Ronit Elkabetz,Mohamed Fellag,Déborah François,Thierry Frémont,Philippe Morier-Genoud,Mostéfa Stiti,François-Xavier Demaison,			Sophie Reine,	Laurent Perez del Mar,	Adeline Bonacchi,

Heleno was no doubt one of the most popular players of his time for his bravura in the field and magnificent goal-scoring that lead the Botafogo team to the top and himself into a vicious downward spiral.	1.52	93200,16657,11548,2433,5591,67721,93201,30666,	Zola Filmes,Agência Nacional do Cinema (ANCINE),BNDES,BR Petrobrás,Downtown Filmes,FINEP/Ministério da Ciência,Goritzia Filmes,RT Features,	BR,,,BR,BR,,BR,BR,	2012-03-29	116	23	6.1	0	Passion.

The film - using a blend of cinema verité and characters' voice over - offers a raw, intimate, and even uplifting look at how patients, executive staff and caregivers each cope with disease, bureaucracy and hard choices. It is a film about fighting for survival when the odds are stacked against you.	2.924				2012-09-26	81	14	7.1	0	One Hospital, Hundreds of stories	Peter Nicks,
